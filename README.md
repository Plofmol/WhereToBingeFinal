# WhereToBingeFinal

## Description:
The WhereToBingeFinal repository contains the final back-end code for a project that is hosted online on Azure. This project aims to provide a platform where users can discover and explore various movies and TV shows to binge-watch. The back-end code serves as the core logic and functionality that powers the platform.

## How it Works:
The back-end code is built using C# .net web Api using Swagger. The back-end code handles data management, user authentication, and the retrieval of relevant information from external sources, such as movie databases or APIs. It processes user requests, retrieves and manipulates data, and sends the necessary responses back to the front-end or client-side of the application.

The project  utilizes a combination of server-side technologies, databases, and APIs to support its functionality. The back-end code  includes features such as user registration, login/authentication, imdb search functionality and integration with external data sources.

## Development Process:
To create this project, I followed a set standard of rules including a combination of Scrum and Kanban  and testing. The development process also includes tasks such as database design, API integration, writing server-side logic, and thorough testing to ensure the reliability and stability of the code.

## Hosting:
The project is hosted on Azure, which is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft. Azure offers a robust infrastructure to deploy and manage applications, making it suitable for hosting web applications and services. By hosting the project on Azure, it benefits from its scalability, reliability, and the ability to handle high traffic loads.

Overall, the WhereToBingeFinal repository contains the final back-end code for a project hosted on Azure, enabling users to discover and explore movies and TV shows through the platform's functionalities.
